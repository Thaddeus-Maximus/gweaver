# GWeaver
This is a set of tools to help write Gcode _in python_. You write a python script, and that python script generates GCode. It's not a GUI frontend. It's really just here to make your life easier.

Future plans:
 - Toolpath generation
 - "Compiled" tool offsets (some machines like Intellitek's don't have real tool diameter compensation)
 - DXF parsing

Dependencies
 - cavaliercontours-python
